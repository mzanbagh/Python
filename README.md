## Selenium Webdriver Automation Testing using Python
<br>
<p>As a Software Development Engineer it is important for me to be able to write automation test scripts to perform various types of tests to validate the functionality, quality and Performance of the software<p>

### What is selenium?

<P>Selenium is a great tool for Automation Testing of Web application & Mobile test along with API / WebServive Testing, Cloud Testing, etc. Selenium can be used with Python, Java, and some other Structured programming languages to automate tests and perform the following test types: <P>

+ Unit Testing
+ Integration Testing
+ System Testing
+ User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
+ and more...  
<br>

### In this program...
<p>The purpose of this program is to cover just the main functionalities of the Selenium Webdriver using Python and how easy it can be to start using the Selenium Webdriver. The intention of this piece of code is to familarize the audience with basic functionalities and encourage curiousity around the Selenium topic. I have decided to keep it simple and not go full depth in the subject so this tutorial can be efficient and effecive for all levels of Engineers<P>

<P>This code intialize the Selenium Webdriver and closes a pop-up using the CSS_Selector method. <P>

### How to work with Selenium?
<P> Selenium is not a built-in package in Python; thus, it can be downloaded using the pip package management system. Once it is installed it can be imported as a whole or only the webdrive can be imported on the machine as needed. <p>
<p>Next, we need to define an executable path to the derired webdriver. In this case I am using the Chrome webdriver thus webdriver executable path is directed to the .exe file in my C:\... directory (See Line 12). <p>
<p>Once webdriver is accesabble it is time to pass in the URL and finalize any optional configurations such as maximize_window().
<p>Selenium finds elemnts in the XML document using various methods, elements can be found by various different forms such as:

+ by_CSS_Selector
+ by_ID
+ by_Name
+ by_Xpath
+ and more...

<p> Depending on the nature of the structure we are working with finding elements may require experience and expertise to properly pinpoint the right element. In general, Xpath, CSS_Selector, and ID are the common types of selectors used by developers to find the target element. <P>

## Summary
<p>In this document I described what Selenium is and how we can utilize it to write scripts for automation testing dor various application. Selenium is the industry leader in automation testing, and it is an important tool for Software Development Engineers to master in order to validate and enhace the quality of their code.
